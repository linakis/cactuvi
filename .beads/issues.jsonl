{"id":"iptv-app-847","title":"Implement Android 12+ Splash Screen API","description":"Implement the Android 12+ Splash Screen API as described in https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen\n\n## Context\nThe app currently uses a custom LoadingActivity as the launcher. Android 12+ (API 31) introduced a native Splash Screen API that provides:\n- Consistent splash screen experience across all apps\n- Smooth animation transitions\n- Proper handling of app launch latency\n- Built-in icon animations and branding options\n\n## Current State\n- LoadingActivity.kt is the LAUNCHER activity\n- Custom loading screen with progress bar and retry logic\n- Checks for configured sources before navigating to MainActivity\n- No use of Android 12+ SplashScreen API\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### 1. Add SplashScreen dependency\nIn app/build.gradle.kts:\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.0.1\")\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Update theme (themes.xml)\nAdd splash screen theme attributes:\n```xml\n\u003cstyle name=\"Theme.IPTVPlayer.Starting\" parent=\"Theme.SplashScreen\"\u003e\n    \u003citem name=\"windowSplashScreenBackground\"\u003e@color/splash_background\u003c/item\u003e\n    \u003citem name=\"windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon\"\u003e@drawable/ic_launcher_foreground\u003c/item\u003e\n    \u003citem name=\"windowSplashScreenAnimationDuration\"\u003e200\u003c/item\u003e\n    \u003citem name=\"postSplashScreenTheme\"\u003e@style/Theme.IPTVPlayer\u003c/item\u003e\n\u003c/style\u003e\n```\n\n### 3. Update AndroidManifest.xml\nChange LoadingActivity theme:\n```xml\n\u003cactivity\n    android:name=\".ui.LoadingActivity\"\n    android:exported=\"true\"\n    android:theme=\"@style/Theme.IPTVPlayer.Starting\"\u003e\n    \u003cintent-filter\u003e\n        \u003caction android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" /\u003e\n        \u003ccategory android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/intent-filter\u003e\n\u003c/activity\u003e\n```\n\n### 4. Update LoadingActivity.kt\nInstall splash screen in onCreate before setContentView:\n```kotlin\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n    // Install splash screen BEFORE super.onCreate()\n    val splashScreen = installSplashScreen()\n    \n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n    \n    // Optional: Keep splash screen visible while loading\n    splashScreen.setKeepOnScreenCondition {\n        // Return true to keep splash screen visible\n        // Return false to dismiss and show LoadingActivity UI\n        isLoading // Example: keep visible while checking sources\n    }\n    \n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_loading)\n    // ... rest of implementation\n}\n```\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n**Questions for clarification:**\n1. Should the splash screen show during the entire source check, or dismiss immediately?\n2. Do we want a custom animated icon or use the app launcher icon?\n3. Should we keep the current LoadingActivity UI for error states (no sources, retry button)?\n4. Do we want to add a brand logo/icon animation?\n\n## Testing Requirements\n- Test on Android 12+ devices/emulators (API 31+)\n- Test on pre-Android 12 devices (backward compatibility)\n- Verify smooth transition from splash → LoadingActivity → MainActivity\n- Test error states (no sources configured)\n- Test retry flow\n- Verify D-pad navigation works on TV after splash screen\n\n## Resources\n- Official guide: https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen\n- Core SplashScreen library: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core\n- Migration guide: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/splash-screen\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- ✅ SplashScreen library dependency added\n- ✅ Splash screen theme configured\n- ✅ installSplashScreen() called in LoadingActivity.onCreate()\n- ✅ Smooth transition from splash to app\n- ✅ Works on Android 12+ (API 31+)\n- ✅ Backward compatible with older Android versions\n- ✅ Error handling (no sources) still works\n- ✅ D-pad navigation unaffected\n- ✅ Manual testing on emulator/device completed\n\n## Files Affected\n- app/build.gradle.kts (dependency)\n- app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml (splash theme)\n- app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml (splash colors, if needed)\n- app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (LoadingActivity theme)\n- app/src/main/java/com/cactuvi/app/ui/LoadingActivity.kt (installSplashScreen call)\n\nEstimated time: 45-60 minutes","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nlinakis@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T22:29:34.643171+02:00","created_by":"Nikos Linakis","updated_at":"2026-01-25T22:29:34.643171+02:00"}

Add \"Testing with Hilt\" Section\n\n```markdown\n## Testing Guide\n\n### Unit Tests (MockK)\n\n**Pattern: Constructor Injection Makes Mocking Easy**\n\n```kotlin\n@OptIn(ExperimentalCoroutinesApi::class)\nclass ContentRepositoryImplTest {\n    private val testDispatcher = UnconfinedTestDispatcher()\n    \n    private lateinit var repository: ContentRepositoryImpl\n    private lateinit var mockDatabase: AppDatabase\n    private lateinit var mockSourceManager: SourceManager\n    \n    @Before\n    fun setup() {\n        Dispatchers.setMain(testDispatcher)\n        \n        // Create mocks\n        mockDatabase = mockk(relaxed = true)\n        mockSourceManager = mockk(relaxed = true)\n        \n        // Create instance via constructor\n        repository = ContentRepositoryImpl(\n            context = mockk(relaxed = true),\n            database = mockDatabase,\n            sourceManager = mockSourceManager,\n            // ... inject all mocks\n        )\n    }\n    \n    @Test\n    fun `cache behavior test`() = runTest {\n        // Given: Mock database returns cached data\n        every { mockDatabase.movieDao().getAll() } returns listOf(mockMovie())\n        \n        // When: Call repository method\n        val result = repository.getMovies()\n        \n        // Then: Verify behavior\n        assertTrue(result.isSuccess)\n        coVerify(exactly = 1) { mockDatabase.movieDao().getAll() }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Flow Testing (Turbine)\n\n```kotlin\n@Test\nfun `observeMovies emits Loading then Success`() = runTest {\n    // Given: Repository configured to return data\n    every { mockRepository.observeMovies() } returns flowOf(\n        Resource.Loading(),\n        Resource.Success(mockNavigationTree())\n    )\n    \n    // When: Collect flow\n    useCase().test {\n        // Then: Verify emissions\n        val loading = awaitItem()\n        assertTrue(loading is Resource.Loading)\n        \n        val success = awaitItem()\n        assertTrue(success is Resource.Success)\n        \n        awaitComplete()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ViewModel Testing\n\n```kotlin\nclass MoviesViewModelTest {\n    private lateinit var viewModel: MoviesViewModel\n    private lateinit var mockUseCase: ObserveMoviesUseCase\n    \n    @Before\n    fun setup() {\n        Dispatchers.setMain(UnconfinedTestDispatcher())\n        mockUseCase = mockk()\n        viewModel = MoviesViewModel(mockUseCase, mockk(), mockk())\n    }\n    \n    @Test\n    fun `initial state is loading`() {\n        assertTrue(viewModel.uiState.value.isLoading)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Integration Tests (Hilt + Instrumented)\n\nFor tests requiring Hilt:\n```kotlin\n@HiltAndroidTest\n@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)\nclass RepositoryIntegrationTest {\n    @get:Rule\n    var hiltRule = HiltAndroidRule(this)\n    \n    @Inject\n    lateinit var repository: ContentRepository\n    \n    @Before\n    fun setup() {\n        hiltRule.inject()\n    }\n    \n    @Test\n    fun testRealDependencies() {\n        // Test with real injected dependencies\n    }\n}\n```\n```\n\n### 3. Update Existing Patterns Section\n\nRemove any references to:\n- Singleton.getInstance() pattern\n- Manual dependency management\n\nReplace with:\n- \"Use @Inject constructor for all classes\"\n- \"Use Hilt modules for third-party/complex dependencies\"\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md has comprehensive DI section\n- ✅ All DI patterns documented with examples\n- ✅ Testing patterns documented for unit/integration tests\n- ✅ WorkManager + Hilt integration documented\n- ✅ No references to getInstance() pattern remain\n- ✅ Code examples are copy-paste ready\n- ✅ Clear guidance for adding new features with DI\n\nFiles: 1 (ARCHITECTURE.md)\nTime: 60 minutes","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nlinakis@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T22:01:18.970584+02:00","created_by":"Nikos Linakis","updated_at":"2026-01-25T22:01:18.970584+02:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"iptv-app-qbx.1.10","depends_on_id":"iptv-app-qbx.1","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-25T22:01:18.973427+02:00","created_by":"Nikos Linakis"}]}

Parallel JSON Parsing (Highest Impact - iptv-app-TBD)\n**Estimated Impact:** 30-40% reduction (124s → 75-85s)\n\nParse Movies, Series, and Live API responses concurrently:\n- All 3 content types fetch simultaneously\n- CPU-bound parsing work parallelized\n- Database writes remain serialized (DbWriter)\n\n**Implementation:**\n```kotlin\nsuspend fun loadAllContentParallel() = coroutineScope {\n    val moviesDeferred = async { getMovies(forceRefresh = true) }\n    val seriesDeferred = async { getSeries(forceRefresh = true) }\n    val liveDeferred = async { getLiveStreams(forceRefresh = true) }\n    \n    awaitAll(moviesDeferred, seriesDeferred, liveDeferred)\n}\n```\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Network: 3 concurrent API calls (check bandwidth limits)\n- Memory: 3 streaming parsers active (monitor heap usage)\n- Database: DbWriter serializes writes (already handled)\n\n### 2. Background Pre-fetch (Best UX - iptv-app-TBD)\n**Estimated Impact:** Perceived 0s load time\n\nStart loading on app launch before user navigates:\n- Trigger from IPTVApplication.onCreate() or LoadingActivity\n- Use WorkManager for background execution\n- Show content immediately when user navigates\n\n**Implementation:**\n```kotlin\n// IPTVApplication.onCreate()\nlifecycleScope.launch {\n    delay(500) // Let app initialization complete\n    contentRepository.warmupCache()\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Best perceived performance (instant content)\n- Users see loading state briefly or not at all\n- No code changes to parsing logic needed\n\n### 3. Stream Parser Tuning (Low-Hanging Fruit - iptv-app-TBD)\n**Estimated Impact:** 5-10% reduction\n\nIncrease batch size from 999 to 2000-3000:\n- Fewer context switches between parsing and DB writes\n- Larger transaction chunks (still within optimal range)\n- Minimal code change\n\n**Testing Required:**\n- Verify memory usage stays acceptable\n- Ensure no performance regression on low-end devices\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Movies: \u003c70s for 135k items (from 124.6s)\n- Series: \u003c20s for 30k items\n- Live: \u003c25s for 45k items\n- Total cold start: \u003c115s (all 3 content types)\n- Memory: Peak heap \u003c150MB\n- No regressions in reliability\n\n## Subtasks\n1. iptv-app-TBD - Implement parallel JSON parsing\n2. iptv-app-TBD - Implement background pre-fetch\n3. iptv-app-TBD - Tune stream parser batch size\n4. iptv-app-TBD - Validation testing\n\n## Risks\n- Parallel parsing may increase memory usage\n- Concurrent API calls may hit provider rate limits\n- Background pre-fetch may conflict with user navigation\n\n## Files\n- ContentRepository.kt (parallel parsing)\n- IPTVApplication.kt (background pre-fetch)\n- StreamingJsonParser.kt (batch size tuning)\n- AppDatabase.kt (if needed)\n\n## References\n- STARTUP_OPTIMIZATION_VALIDATION.md (Phase 2 results)\n- Phase 2 commits: f612dc2, 9e987a9","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nlinakis@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-24T18:26:25.912494+02:00","created_by":"Nikos Linakis","updated_at":"2026-01-24T18:26:25.912494+02:00"}

This provides perceived instant load times.\n\n## Current State\n- Content loads when user navigates to Movies/Series/Live tabs\n- User sees loading indicator for 2+ minutes\n- Poor first-impression UX\n\n## Target UX\n- Content pre-fetched in background during app launch\n- User navigates to Movies → data already available (instant)\n- Brief loading indicator or none at all\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Option 1: IPTVApplication.onCreate() (Recommended)\n```kotlin\nclass IPTVApplication : Application() {\n    override fun onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate()\n        \n        // Existing initialization...\n        warmupCaches()\n        \n        // NEW: Background pre-fetch after brief delay\n        GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {\n            delay(1000) // Let app initialization complete\n            \n            val sourceManager = SourceManager.getInstance(this@IPTVApplication)\n            if (sourceManager.getActiveSource() != null) {\n                val repository = ContentRepository(sourceManager, this@IPTVApplication)\n                \n                // Trigger parallel background load\n                repository.loadAllContentParallel()\n                \n                PerformanceLogger.log(\"Background pre-fetch completed\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: LoadingActivity (Alternative)\n```kotlin\nclass LoadingActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        \n        // Check if source configured\n        val source = SourceManager.getInstance(this).getActiveSource()\n        \n        if (source != null) {\n            // Start background pre-fetch\n            lifecycleScope.launch {\n                repository.loadAllContentParallel()\n            }\n            \n            // Navigate to home immediately (don't wait)\n            startActivity(Intent(this, HomeActivity::class.java))\n            finish()\n        } else {\n            // Show source setup\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Considerations\n\n### When to Start Pre-fetch\n1. **After app initialization** - Don't block critical startup\n2. **Check if source configured** - Skip if no credentials\n3. **Check if already cached** - Skip if data fresh (TTL check)\n4. **Consider VPN requirement** - Respect VPN guard setting\n\n### User Experience\n- **Best case:** Content loads in \u003c10s, user navigates and sees instant results\n- **Worst case:** User navigates before pre-fetch complete, shows loading state (no worse than current)\n- **Progress indicator:** Show subtle notification or status in toolbar\n\n### Error Handling\n- Silent failures (don't show errors during background load)\n- Log errors for debugging\n- User can trigger manual refresh if needed\n\n## Testing\n\n### Test Scenarios\n1. **Cold start** - No cache, pre-fetch completes before navigation\n2. **Fast navigation** - User navigates before pre-fetch completes\n3. **No network** - Pre-fetch fails, manual load succeeds later\n4. **VPN disabled** - Pre-fetch respects VPN guard\n5. **App backgrounded** - Pre-fetch continues in background\n\n### Validation\n```bash\n# Test cold start with pre-fetch\nadb shell pm clear com.iptv.app\nadb logcat -c\nadb shell am start -n com.iptv.app/.ui.LoadingActivity\n\n# Wait 30s, then navigate to Movies\nadb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DPAD_DOWN\nadb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER\n\n# Check logs - should show cache HIT\nadb logcat -d | grep \"CACHE HIT\\|navigationTree\"\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n- Pre-fetch triggers within 1-2s of app launch\n- Content available in 60-90s (parallel load time)\n- User navigation shows cached data (instant)\n- No blocking or UI freezing\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Add pre-fetch trigger** to IPTVApplication or LoadingActivity\n2. **Check prerequisites** (source configured, VPN if required)\n3. **Use parallel loading** (iptv-app-wnc.1 dependency)\n4. **Handle errors gracefully** (silent failures, logging)\n5. **Add logging** for monitoring pre-fetch success rate\n6. **Consider notification** (optional subtle UI indicator)\n\n## Risks\n\n### Medium Risk\n- Background load may conflict with user-initiated loads\n- Memory usage during background load (monitor)\n- Battery usage concerns (mitigate: only on WiFi?)\n\n### Low Risk\n- VPN requirement blocking pre-fetch (already handled)\n- App killed during pre-fetch (graceful degradation)\n\n## Enhancements (Optional)\n\n1. **WiFi-only pre-fetch** - Check network type, skip on cellular\n2. **Battery-aware** - Skip if low battery (\u003c20%)\n3. **Progress notification** - Show system notification with progress\n4. **Adaptive timing** - Adjust delay based on device performance\n\n## Files\n- IPTVApplication.kt or LoadingActivity.kt (pre-fetch trigger)\n- ContentRepository.kt (ensure parallel load available)\n\n## Success Criteria\n✅ Pre-fetch triggers on app launch\n✅ User navigation to Movies/Series/Live shows instant results (cache hit)\n✅ No UI blocking or performance degradation\n✅ Graceful handling of errors and edge cases\n✅ User experience significantly improved\n\n## Dependencies\n- iptv-app-wnc.1 (parallel JSON parsing) -
