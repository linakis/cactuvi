Parallel JSON Parsing (Highest Impact - iptv-app-TBD)\n**Estimated Impact:** 30-40% reduction (124s → 75-85s)\n\nParse Movies, Series, and Live API responses concurrently:\n- All 3 content types fetch simultaneously\n- CPU-bound parsing work parallelized\n- Database writes remain serialized (DbWriter)\n\n**Implementation:**\n```kotlin\nsuspend fun loadAllContentParallel() = coroutineScope {\n    val moviesDeferred = async { getMovies(forceRefresh = true) }\n    val seriesDeferred = async { getSeries(forceRefresh = true) }\n    val liveDeferred = async { getLiveStreams(forceRefresh = true) }\n    \n    awaitAll(moviesDeferred, seriesDeferred, liveDeferred)\n}\n```\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Network: 3 concurrent API calls (check bandwidth limits)\n- Memory: 3 streaming parsers active (monitor heap usage)\n- Database: DbWriter serializes writes (already handled)\n\n### 2. Background Pre-fetch (Best UX - iptv-app-TBD)\n**Estimated Impact:** Perceived 0s load time\n\nStart loading on app launch before user navigates:\n- Trigger from IPTVApplication.onCreate() or LoadingActivity\n- Use WorkManager for background execution\n- Show content immediately when user navigates\n\n**Implementation:**\n```kotlin\n// IPTVApplication.onCreate()\nlifecycleScope.launch {\n    delay(500) // Let app initialization complete\n    contentRepository.warmupCache()\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Best perceived performance (instant content)\n- Users see loading state briefly or not at all\n- No code changes to parsing logic needed\n\n### 3. Stream Parser Tuning (Low-Hanging Fruit - iptv-app-TBD)\n**Estimated Impact:** 5-10% reduction\n\nIncrease batch size from 999 to 2000-3000:\n- Fewer context switches between parsing and DB writes\n- Larger transaction chunks (still within optimal range)\n- Minimal code change\n\n**Testing Required:**\n- Verify memory usage stays acceptable\n- Ensure no performance regression on low-end devices\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Movies: \u003c70s for 135k items (from 124.6s)\n- Series: \u003c20s for 30k items\n- Live: \u003c25s for 45k items\n- Total cold start: \u003c115s (all 3 content types)\n- Memory: Peak heap \u003c150MB\n- No regressions in reliability\n\n## Subtasks\n1. iptv-app-TBD - Implement parallel JSON parsing\n2. iptv-app-TBD - Implement background pre-fetch\n3. iptv-app-TBD - Tune stream parser batch size\n4. iptv-app-TBD - Validation testing\n\n## Risks\n- Parallel parsing may increase memory usage\n- Concurrent API calls may hit provider rate limits\n- Background pre-fetch may conflict with user navigation\n\n## Files\n- ContentRepository.kt (parallel parsing)\n- IPTVApplication.kt (background pre-fetch)\n- StreamingJsonParser.kt (batch size tuning)\n- AppDatabase.kt (if needed)\n\n## References\n- STARTUP_OPTIMIZATION_VALIDATION.md (Phase 2 results)\n- Phase 2 commits: f612dc2, 9e987a9","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nlinakis@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-24T18:26:25.912494+02:00","created_by":"Nikos Linakis","updated_at":"2026-01-24T18:26:25.912494+02:00"}

{"id":"iptv-app-wnc.2","title":"Implement background pre-fetch on app launch","description":"## Goal\nStart loading content in background on app launch, before user navigates to content screens. This provides perceived instant load times.\n\n## Current State\n- Content loads when user navigates to Movies/Series/Live tabs\n- User sees loading indicator for 2+ minutes\n- Poor first-impression UX\n\n## Target UX\n- Content pre-fetched in background during app launch\n- User navigates to Movies → data already available (instant)\n- Brief loading indicator or none at all\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Option 1: IPTVApplication.onCreate() (Recommended)\n```kotlin\nclass IPTVApplication : Application() {\n    override fun onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate()\n        \n        // Existing initialization...\n        warmupCaches()\n        \n        // NEW: Background pre-fetch after brief delay\n        GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {\n            delay(1000) // Let app initialization complete\n            \n            val sourceManager = SourceManager.getInstance(this@IPTVApplication)\n            if (sourceManager.getActiveSource() != null) {\n                val repository = ContentRepository(sourceManager, this@IPTVApplication)\n                \n                // Trigger parallel background load\n                repository.loadAllContentParallel()\n                \n                PerformanceLogger.log(\"Background pre-fetch completed\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: LoadingActivity (Alternative)\n```kotlin\nclass LoadingActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        \n        // Check if source configured\n        val source = SourceManager.getInstance(this).getActiveSource()\n        \n        if (source != null) {\n            // Start background pre-fetch\n            lifecycleScope.launch {\n                repository.loadAllContentParallel()\n            }\n            \n            // Navigate to home immediately (don't wait)\n            startActivity(Intent(this, HomeActivity::class.java))\n            finish()\n        } else {\n            // Show source setup\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Considerations\n\n### When to Start Pre-fetch\n1. **After app initialization** - Don't block critical startup\n2. **Check if source configured** - Skip if no credentials\n3. **Check if already cached** - Skip if data fresh (TTL check)\n4. **Consider VPN requirement** - Respect VPN guard setting\n\n### User Experience\n- **Best case:** Content loads in \u003c10s, user navigates and sees instant results\n- **Worst case:** User navigates before pre-fetch complete, shows loading state (no worse than current)\n- **Progress indicator:** Show subtle notification or status in toolbar\n\n### Error Handling\n- Silent failures (don't show errors during background load)\n- Log errors for debugging\n- User can trigger manual refresh if needed\n\n## Testing\n\n### Test Scenarios\n1. **Cold start** - No cache, pre-fetch completes before navigation\n2. **Fast navigation** - User navigates before pre-fetch completes\n3. **No network** - Pre-fetch fails, manual load succeeds later\n4. **VPN disabled** - Pre-fetch respects VPN guard\n5. **App backgrounded** - Pre-fetch continues in background\n\n### Validation\n```bash\n# Test cold start with pre-fetch\nadb shell pm clear com.iptv.app\nadb logcat -c\nadb shell am start -n com.iptv.app/.ui.LoadingActivity\n\n# Wait 30s, then navigate to Movies\nadb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DPAD_DOWN\nadb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER\n\n# Check logs - should show cache HIT\nadb logcat -d | grep \"CACHE HIT\\|navigationTree\"\n```\n\n### Expected Results\n- Pre-fetch triggers within 1-2s of app launch\n- Content available in 60-90s (parallel load time)\n- User navigation shows cached data (instant)\n- No blocking or UI freezing\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Add pre-fetch trigger** to IPTVApplication or LoadingActivity\n2. **Check prerequisites** (source configured, VPN if required)\n3. **Use parallel loading** (iptv-app-wnc.1 dependency)\n4. **Handle errors gracefully** (silent failures, logging)\n5. **Add logging** for monitoring pre-fetch success rate\n6. **Consider notification** (optional subtle UI indicator)\n\n## Risks\n\n### Medium Risk\n- Background load may conflict with user-initiated loads\n- Memory usage during background load (monitor)\n- Battery usage concerns (mitigate: only on WiFi?)\n\n### Low Risk\n- VPN requirement blocking pre-fetch (already handled)\n- App killed during pre-fetch (graceful degradation)\n\n## Enhancements (Optional)\n\n1. **WiFi-only pre-fetch** - Check network type, skip on cellular\n2. **Battery-aware** - Skip if low battery (\u003c20%)\n3. **Progress notification** - Show system notification with progress\n4. **Adaptive timing** - Adjust delay based on device performance\n\n## Files\n- IPTVApplication.kt or LoadingActivity.kt (pre-fetch trigger)\n- ContentRepository.kt (ensure parallel load available)\n\n## Success Criteria\n✅ Pre-fetch triggers on app launch\n✅ User navigation to Movies/Series/Live shows instant results (cache hit)\n✅ No UI blocking or performance degradation\n✅ Graceful handling of errors and edge cases\n✅ User experience significantly improved\n\n## Dependencies\n- iptv-app-wnc.1 (parallel JSON parsing) -
